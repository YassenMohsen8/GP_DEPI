## Project Overview
As financial transactions become more prevalent in the digital space, fraud detection is critical for preventing financial losses. This project focuses on building a system to detect fraudulent activities using machine learning models and techniques like NLP to analyze transaction descriptions.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalizing, and handling missing data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and more.
- **NLP Integration**: Natural Language Processing for better analysis of transaction descriptions.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling**: Using techniques like SMOTE for synthetic oversampling.
- **MLOps**: Model management and tracking using MLflow.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy)
- **MLOps**: MLflow for experiment tracking and model management
- **Techniques**: SMOTE, Random Sampling, NLP

## Project Aims
- **Goal**: Develop a fraud detection system that handles imbalanced data and accurately identifies fraud.
- **Objectives**:
  1. Data preprocessing
  2. Statistical analysis
  3. Machine learning model development
  4. NLP for transaction description analysis
  5. Model tracking with MLflow

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Imbalanced Data**: Solved with SMOTE to balance class distribution.
- **Missing Values**: Cleaned and imputed using data handling techniques.
- **Initial Bias**: Optimized models to improve recall and F1-score using balancing techniques.

## Results
- Improved recall and F1-score after applying balancing techniques.
- Enhanced fraud detection using NLP on transaction descriptions.
- Streamlined model tracking with MLflow.

## Conclusion
The project successfully built a fraud detection system that handles imbalanced data and demonstrates reliable performance. Future improvements could include the use of deep learning models and real-time data processing.
